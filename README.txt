
Hello, I am Michael R.  

	I have created this website to demonstrate my ability to work with front-end programming.  
This website is a simple one-page design that serves as a light representation of my resume and skills.  
I apologize if something isn’t perfect, and please feel free to reach out with any feedback or suggestions.

	I used one of the beautiful themes from Strata by HTML5 UP, and I want to give full credit and express my gratitude to them for providing such a great resource.  
This is my first attempt at creating a website, and I hope you enjoy it!

A simple, minimalist template that actually began life as an unused redesign of my
personal site. Includes a (configurable) parallax background effect, Poptrox-powered
lightbox gallery, a bunch of pre-styled elements, and Sass sources for the Sass-inclined.
